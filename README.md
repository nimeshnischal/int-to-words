# int to words (python)

A simple python program to print an integer between 1 to 9999 in words.

During Dell's placement procedures in my college, a coding round was organized in which I had got a question to design an algorithm which stated "Convert an int in between 1 to 999 to words".
At that time, I tried really hard to design the algo using C. Thankfully, in the end I had created quite a large algo which the company's coordinators were satisfied with.

Now, while learning python, I noticed that the feature of dictionary in python is an excellent tool for this problem and it hugely reduces the code size and complexity of the program.

Another reason to choose Python over other programming languages.
 ## Hail Python!
